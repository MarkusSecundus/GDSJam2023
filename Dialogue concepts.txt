Actually accepted questions:
Group AGE:
	"Could you just repeat how old you are again?" (Three random values, including the actual one)
 	"By the way, this bar is mostly for ages 30-35."
	->I'm a bit young then, but I will manage.
	->"I'm exactly in that range then!"
	->"I may be a bit old for it, but I want to experience how I felt back then again."
Group NAME:	
	"Do you have any other document to prove this is you? No? Then tell me what your name is, just so I am sure."
	(RNG three)
	"Oh, I think my name's the same as you."
	->Are you also named XYZ? (RNG three)
	
Group SURNAME:
	"Could you confirm me your surname?"
	(RNG three)
	"What's your surname? I think I know someone with the surname."
	->"Wait, you know another XYZ?"
	"I hope you enjoy yourself here Mr. XYZ"
		->"Thanks."
		->two answers of "Thanks. Just one thing: My surname is XYZ"
	
Group TOWN OF ORIGIN/RESIDENCE:
	"You know, have you ever been to XYZ?"
	->Not origin/residence: "I don't live there, nor was I born there."
	->"I was born there."
	->"I live there now, actually."
	(Note: requires a slight modification of the actual system, doable IMO.)

	"So, where do you live now?"
	(Again, randomized three answers)
	
	"Where were you born? I think I come from the same city."
	(Same, three random)

Group MARITAL status

	->I haven't even had a wife
	->My wife's still alive and with me, you must have read that wrong.
	->Thanks...
	
	"Married, eh? Hope I am as lucky as you are."
	->Single, sadly.
	->Yeah. It's no rose garden, but I'm happy.
	->Can we please not talk about my departed wife?

Fuckup: "Wait, that doesn't match with what the ID says. Stay right here, I'm calling the cops."
