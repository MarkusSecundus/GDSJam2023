Actually accepted questions:
	"Could you just repeat how old you are again?" (Three random values, including the actual one)
 
	"Do you have any other document to prove this is you? No? Then tell me what your name is, just so I am sure."
	"So, what's your surname? I think I know someone with the surname."
	(Choose from three each)
	
	Town of origin/residence:
	"You know, have you ever been to XYZ?"
	->Not origin/residence: "I don't live there, nor was I born there."
	->"I was born there."
	->"I live there now, actually."
	(Note: requires a slight modification of the actual system, doable IMO.)

NOTE: Ideally I want another 5-6 questions.
